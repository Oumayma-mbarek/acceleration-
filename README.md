# acceleration-
measuring the height of a building by measuring the speed of an elevator from its acceleration(using the Euler method) 
the derived product of acceleration is speed and its derived product is the position so we get the height of the building 
knowing that each floor has a height of 3 meters, we can conclude the number of floors in the building 
measuring the speed of a metro by measuring its acceleration with the mobile app phyphox 
Then applying the Euler method which helps calculate the derived product of a certain value 
This way we can get the speed of the metro
